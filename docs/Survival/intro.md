# Introduction

This category contains Basic Survival Concepts, you may find useful while your time on the Moonball Network.

The Moonball Survival is a unique Minecraft gaming experience.
To enjoy the gamemode to the fullest, you need to know the basics.

We have multiple game enriching features, including:

### Enchanting System ###

We have a custom enchanting system, which allows you to enchant items with custom enchantments.
Custom Enchantment books can be bought through in-game EXP, or by trading with other players.

There's also a small chance to get custom enchants from an Enchanting Table or from a Treasure chest!

### Buy/Sell System ###

We have a custom buy/sell system on our server.  
You can use the in-game currency to buy and sell items.
To buy an item, you need to execute the command `/shop`  
A GUI will open, where you can see all the items you can buy.

To sell items on the other hand, You can do `/sell`.
Or if you prefer a GUI, `/sellgui`.

### Drugs ###

We have a custom drug system, which allows you to use drugs.
Drugs give you a temporary effect, but too many drugs
accumulate and add to an addiction level. Which upon reaching a certain threshold,
will kill you.


### Claiming System ###

To protect the valuable builds of our players, we have implemented a claiming system. 
You can claim blocks with accumulated claim-blocks.  
Claiming will let others not
break any blocks or item which is present within your claimed area.  

You can `/trust` other players thought, Which will give them access to your land


### Crates ###

We have crates which will give you back a random item. 
There are multiple types of crates, for example "Blocks" which has a
small chance of giving you a Netherite block or can give you cobblestone if you're 
not lucky!

Crate keys can be obtained by `/vote`ing for our server or from the item shop!
