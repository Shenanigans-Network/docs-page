# Introduction

This category contains Basic Skyblock Concepts, you may find useful while your time on the Moonball Network.

Skyblock is a survival map where players live and build on a floating island. 
The goal of the map is to survive without cheating, expand your island, grow your own food, and thrive.

We have three skyblock starter island biomes, which you can select while creating your island.
Each one of them has the same items and rewards but a different layout.

To enjoy the game-mode to the fullest, you need to know the basics.
We have multiple game enriching features, including:


### Island Upgrades ###

You can upgrade your island using Crystals, and Economy.
Crystals are obtained through challenges.

There are multiple island upgrades, which are:
- Island Size Upgrade: Increases Island size (3 levels)

- Block Limit Upgrade: Increase block limit (5 levels)
- Warp Limit Upgrade: Unlock more warps created (5 levels)

### Island Missions ###

Our server has a mission system, which allows you to complete missions.
You can complete missions to gain Coins, Crystals and Island XP.

There are multiple types of missions, Daily and Island Missions.
Daily Missions shuffle a new mission every day. Whereas Island Missions are specific to your island and don't shuffle.


### Island Permissions ###

We have a permission system, which allows you to set custom permissions for your island.   
Allow or deny specific users from joining your island, make your island private or public, trust specific users, and more!


### Custom Ore Generators ###

On our server, Ore generators are upgradable. This allows the generator to spawn in actual ores, rather than just blocks. 
They can be upgraded to the point where they give diamond ore and netherite ore too!
